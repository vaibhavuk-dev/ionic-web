  "description": "Ionic's Chlorine Dioxide Generator is a cutting-edge, fully automated system designed to produce chlorine dioxide (ClO₂) on-site, ensuring safe and efficient disinfection. With a disinfection power 2.5 times greater than free chlorine, ClO₂ remains effective across a wide pH range, making it ideal for applications in potable water treatment, food processing, and wastewater management. The system utilizes sodium chlorite (NaClO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) as precursor chemicals to generate ClO₂ with minimal by-products, ensuring environmental compliance.",
